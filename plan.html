<h1>CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Aleena Neupane</strong><br>
<strong>Login: jc505638</strong></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The cossiePlay web site is intended
to "increase revenue for cossiePlay" by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeating customers.The major goals to be fulfilled are listed below:
	<ul> 
		<li>To increase the flow of site visitors by posting attractive discounts</li> 
		<li>As the business gets cosplayers of all age groups, the idea is to make the webite accessible by almost every age group</li>
		<li>To furthur develop the site as an E-Commerse site</li> 
	</ul> 
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Other advertising will be consistent for a period of "3 months" (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>As dressing up is fun and good for the socially awkward and is very creative. The target audience will be mostly  35 - 50 age groups, some younger audience such as high school kids and young adults.</p>
